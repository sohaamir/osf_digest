Psychiatry,"Title: How visual experience shapes body representation
Authors: Shahzad, Iqra; Occelli, Valeria; Giraudet, Eleonore; Azanon, Elena; Longo, Matthew; Moruaux, Andre; Collignon, Olivier
Summary: We do not have a veridical representation of our body in our mind. For instance, tactile distances of equal measure along the medial-lateral axis of our limbs are generally perceived as larger than those running along the proximal-distal axis. This anisotropy in tactile distances reflects distortions in body-shape representation.

Title: Towards understanding and halting legacies of trauma
Authors: Taylor, William; Korobkova, Laura; Bhinderwala, Nabeel; Dias, Brian G
Summary: Echoes of natural and anthropogenic traumas reverberate within the physiology, biology, and neurobiology of the generation directly exposed to them. With the intent of understanding this phenomenon, significant efforts have sought to establish multi-generational legacies of experiences like stress, chemical exposures, nutritional impoverishment, and chemosensory experiences.

Title: Suicide ideation severity predicts reduced oculomotor avoidance of suicide-related stimuli
Authors: Sherifi, Emilia; Rowe, Megan; Armstrong, Thomas; Stewart, Jeremy G
Summary: Cognitive theories of suicide identify attentional processes that may vary for individuals at greater suicide risk. The current study utilizes eye-tracking with a novel passive viewing task to explore differences in viewing patterns for suicide- and neutral-image pairings.

Title: Real-time antecedents and correlates of functional neurological symptoms in daily life:  A pilot remote monitoring technology study
Authors: Pick, Susannah; Millman, L. S. Merritt; Hodsoll, John; Stanton, Biba; David, Anthony S; Edwards, Mark J; Goldstein, Laura H; Mehta, Mitul; Nicholson, Timothy; Reinders, A.A.T.S.; Winston, Joel S; Chalder, Trudie; Hotopf, Matthew
Summary:  Remote monitoring technologies (RMT) could provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying functional neurological symptoms (FNS) We examined the feasibility and acceptability of a novel RMT protocol.

Title: Anxiety symptom trajectories across development: risk factors and outcomes
Authors: Palaiologou, Elisavet; Skelton, Megan; Assary, Elham; Breen, Gerome; Hotopf, Matthew; Morneau-Vaillancourt, Genevieve; Thompson, Ellen J; Lockhart, Celestine L; McGregor, Thomas; Plomin, Robert; Carr, Ewan; Eley, Thalia C
Summary: Anxiety is one of the most common conditions affecting young people. The onset and course of symptoms are highly variable across development. We modelled trajectories of anxiety symptoms from childhood to early adulthood. We examined associated predictors and adult outcomes.

Title: A Neurocognitive Framework for Psychedelics as Learning Opportunities
Authors: Mattek, Sonny
Summary: This paper proposes a novel framework that shifts the focus from the disruptive aspects of serotonergic psychedelics to their potential as learning opportunities. The orienting response, mediated by the noradrenergic system, leads to psychological and neurophysiological features characteristic of psychedelic states.

Title: Risky decision-making and nonsuicidal self-injury among young adults: Examining the role of criticism feedback
Authors: Nancekivell, Brooke; Martin, Lily; Jacobson, Jill A; Allen, Kenneth J D (; Stewart, Jeremy G
Summary: Study included 286 university students oversampled for a lifetime history of NSSI. Participants completed a modified Iowa Gambling Task, in which they chose to play or pass on ""good"" and ""bad"" decks associated with monetary gains and losses. Participants also completed the Criticism Gambling task, which was identical to the Iowa G gambling Task except critical audio comments preceded each block of trials.

Title: Metacognitive biases in anxious-depression and compulsivity extend across perception and memory
Authors: Seow, Tricia X F; Fleming, Stephen M; Hauser, Tobias U
Summary: Metacognitive biases are characteristic of common mental health disorders like depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Recent transdiagnostic approaches consistently contradict traditional clinical studies. We investigated whether these divergences arise due to cognitive domain-specific effects, comorbid overshadowing effects, and/or different manifestations at disparate levels of the metacognitive hierarchy.

Title: The role of social deprivation and cannabis use in explaining variation in the incidence of psychotic disorders: findings from the EU-GEI study
Authors: Brink, Vera E; Andleeb, Humma; van Os, Jim; Quattrone, Diego; Jones, Peter B; Di Forti, Marta; Jongsma, Hannah; Kirkbride, James B
Summary: Recent findings suggest the incidence of first episode psychotic disorders varies according to setting-level deprivation and cannabis use. We hypothesized deprivation would be more strongly associated with variation in FEP incidence than prevalence of daily or high-potency cannabis use between settings. We used incidence data in people aged 18-64 from 14 settings of the EU-GEI study.

Cognitive Neuroscience,"Title: Suicide ideation severity predicts reduced oculomotor avoidance of suicide-related stimuli
Authors: Sherifi, Emilia; Rowe, Megan; Armstrong, Thomas; Stewart, Jeremy G
Summary: Cognitive theories of suicide identify attentional processes that may vary for individuals at greater suicide risk. The current study utilizes eye-tracking with a novel passive viewing task to explore differences in viewing patterns for suicide- and neutral-image pairings.

Title: An EEG-study on the extent to which partisanship conditions the processing of politicians' faces
Authors: Jesus, Gustavo; Homan, Maaike; Petalas, Diamantis P; Bakker, Bert N; Bathelt, Joe; Schumacher, Gijs
Summary: Faces of political leaders elicit a stronger N170 ERP response than faces of strangers. We did not find the same pattern for the N250 component. No statistically significant differences in the P200 and N200 components between in-party and out-party leader faces.

Title: Increases in EEG Alpha Power and Beta Power Following a VR Psychedelic Journey
Authors: Mattek, Sonny
Summary: Inner State VR experience was designed as a drugless psychedelic journey that mimics a microdosing experience. We found the post-VR brain activity showed increases in power in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, compared to pre- VR.

Title: Metacognitive biases in anxious-depression and compulsivity extend across perception and memory

Summary: Metacognitive biases are characteristic of common mental health disorders like depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Recent transdiagnostic approaches consistently contradict traditional clinical studies. We investigated whether these divergences arise due to cognitive domain-specific effects, comorbid overshadowing effects, and/or different manifestations at disparate levels of the metacognitive hierarchy.

Title: Not Simply Two Sides of the Same Coin: Target Enhancement and Distractor Suppression Draw on Independent Neural Mechanisms
Authors: Khodayari, Natalia; Egeth, Howard; courtney, susan
Summary: Recent evidence indicates that target enhancement and distractor suppression can be measured separately, using both behavioral and physiological approaches. It is unclear whether the underlying mechanisms are also separable. We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals.

Title: Social learning in models and minds
Authors: Yon, Daniel; heyes, cecilia
Summary: After more than a century in which social learning was blackboxed by evolutionary biologists, psychologists and economists, there is now a thriving industry in cognitive neuroscience. This is a hugely positive development. But we argue that, from the perspective of a scientific realist, these tools are not yet being applied in an optimal way.

Title: Mathematized Phenomenology and the Science of Consciousness
Authors: Prentner, Robert
Summary: In this contribution, we emphasize the relevance of mathematical approaches to the first-person perspective. We also sketch some potential ways that mathematics could be used in phenomenology. We then discuss how this could be usefully applied to the (neuro)scientific study of consciousness.

Title: Default mode network anti-correlation as a transdiagnostic biomarker of cognitive function
Authors: Tripathi, Vaibhav; Batta, Ishaan; Zamani, Andre; Atad, Daniel A; Sheth, Sneha K; Zhang, Jiahe; Wager, Tor; Whitfield-Gabrieli, Susan; Uddin, Lucina Q; Prakash, Ruchika; Bauer, Clemens C
Summary: The default mode network (DMN) is intricately linked with processes such as self-referential thinking, episodic memory recall, and understanding the mindset of others. Over recent years, there has been a surge in examining its functional connectivity, particularly its antagonistic relationship with frontoparietal networks.
