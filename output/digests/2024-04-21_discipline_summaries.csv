Psychiatry,"Title: The architecture of spontaneous thoughts and experiences: a graph theory approach.
Authors: Coppola, Peter; Sikka, Pilleriin; Valli, Katja; Tuominen, Jarno; Revonsuo, Antti; Loukola, Ville; Bernstein, Ryan; , nanna.strif; Kirberg, Manuela; Ezquerro-Nassar, Alejandro; Windt, Jennifer; Noreika, Valdas; mota, natalia; Bekinschtein, Tristan
Summary: The language people use in everyday life provides a window into the mind. Mind-wandering and dreams have been thought to reflect unique individual differences and mental health. We find that dream reports have a more complex structure. We also find that word centrality in dreams is predictive of depression symptoms.

Title: How visual experience shapes body representation
Authors: Shahzad, Iqra; Occelli, Valeria; Giraudet, Eleonore; Azanon, Elena; Longo, Matthew; Moruaux, Andre; Collignon, Olivier
Summary: We do not have a veridical representation of our body in our mind. For instance, tactile distances of equal measure along the medial-lateral axis of our limbs are generally perceived as larger than those running along the proximal-distal axis. This anisotropy in tactile distances reflects distortions in body-shape representation.

Title: Towards understanding and halting legacies of trauma
Authors: Taylor, William; Korobkova, Laura; Bhinderwala, Nabeel; Dias, Brian G
Summary: Echoes of natural and anthropogenic traumas reverberate within the physiology, biology, and neurobiology of the generation directly exposed to them. With the intent of understanding this phenomenon, significant efforts have sought to establish multi-generational legacies of experiences like stress, chemical exposures, nutritional impoverishment, and chemosensory experiences.

Title: Suicide ideation severity predicts reduced oculomotor avoidance of suicide-related stimuli
Authors: Sherifi, Emilia; Rowe, Megan; Armstrong, Thomas; Stewart, Jeremy G
Summary: Cognitive theories of suicide identify attentional processes that may vary for individuals at greater suicide risk. The current study utilizes eye-tracking with a novel passive viewing task to explore differences in viewing patterns for suicide- and neutral-image pairings.

Title: Real-time antecedents and correlates of functional neurological symptoms in daily life:  A pilot remote monitoring technology study
Authors: Pick, Susannah; Millman, L. S. Merritt; Hodsoll, John; Stanton, Biba; David, Anthony S; Edwards, Mark J; Goldstein, Laura H; Mehta, Mitul; Nicholson, Timothy; Reinders, A.A.T.S.; Winston, Joel S; Chalder, Trudie; Hotopf, Matthew
Summary:  Remote monitoring technologies (RMT) could provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying functional neurological symptoms (FNS) We examined the feasibility and acceptability of a novel RMT protocol.

Title: Anxiety symptom trajectories across development: risk factors and outcomes
Authors: Palaiologou, Elisavet; Skelton, Megan; Assary, Elham; Breen, Gerome; Hotopf, Matthew; Morneau-Vaillancourt, Genevieve; Thompson, Ellen J; Lockhart, Celestine L; McGregor, Thomas; Plomin, Robert; Carr, Ewan; Eley, Thalia C
Summary: Anxiety is one of the most common conditions affecting young people. The onset and course of symptoms are highly variable across development. We modelled trajectories of anxiety symptoms from childhood to early adulthood. We examined associated predictors and adult outcomes.

Title: A Neurocognitive Framework for Psychedelics as Learning Opportunities
Authors: Mattek, Sonny
Summary: This paper proposes a novel framework that shifts the focus from the disruptive aspects of serotonergic psychedelics to their potential as learning opportunities. The orienting response, mediated by the noradrenergic system, leads to psychological and neurophysiological features characteristic of psychedelic states.

Title: Risky decision-making and nonsuicidal self-injury among young adults: Examining the role of criticism feedback
Authors: Nancekivell, Brooke; Martin, Lily; Jacobson, Jill A; Allen, Kenneth J D (; Stewart, Jeremy G
Summary: Study included 286 university students oversampled for a lifetime history of NSSI. Participants completed a modified Iowa Gambling Task, in which they chose to play or pass on ""good"" and ""bad"" decks associated with monetary gains and losses. Participants also completed the Criticism Gambling task, which was identical to the Iowa G gambling Task except critical audio comments preceded each block of trials.

Title: Metacognitive biases in anxious-depression and compulsivity extend across perception and memory
Authors: Seow, Tricia X F; Fleming, Stephen M; Hauser, Tobias U
Summary: Metacognitive biases are characteristic of common mental health disorders like depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Recent transdiagnostic approaches consistently contradict traditional clinical studies. We investigated whether these divergences arise due to cognitive domain-specific effects, comorbid overshadowing effects, and/or different manifestations at disparate levels of the metacognitive hierarchy.

Title: The role of social deprivation and cannabis use in explaining variation in the incidence of psychotic disorders: findings from the EU-GEI study
Authors: Brink, Vera E; Andleeb, Humma; van Os, Jim; Quattrone, Diego; Jones, Peter B; Di Forti, Marta; Jongsma, Hannah; Kirkbride, James B
Summary: Recent findings suggest the incidence of first episode psychotic disorders varies according to setting-level deprivation and cannabis use. We hypothesized deprivation would be more strongly associated with variation in FEP incidence than prevalence of daily or high-potency cannabis use between settings. We used incidence data in people aged 18-64 from 14 settings of the EU-GEI study.

Title: SAS-1: A single-item smartphone addiction scale
Authors: Olson, Jay A; Langer, Ellen J; Martin, Loren
Summary: Current measures of smartphone addiction are often too long for some contexts, such as large-scale surveys or pilot studies. We tested a single-item measure that probes agreement with the statement: 'I am addicted to my smartphone' Across 7,827 participants aged 18 to 89 from 131 countries, 37% agreed or strongly agreed with this statement.

Title: A psychopathological theory-driven early relapse prediction model using speech and language in psychosis
Authors: Dalal, Tyler C; Park, Min T M; Silva, Angelica; Iskhakova, Svetlana; Voppel, Alban; Brierley, Noah; Mackinley, Michael; Olarewaju, Emmanuel; Palaniyappan, Lena
Summary: Language-based prediction of psychotic relapse using speech-derived markers offers a promising avenue for targeted prevention in early intervention. The sheer number of speech markers and the 'black box' nature of predictive models present significant challenges for clinical translation. Successful real-world predictions require the underlying model to be a 'reasonable facsimile' of the clinical phenomena.

Title: Generative AI-Enabled Therapy Support Tool Improves Clinical Outcomes and Patient Engagement in NHS Talking Therapies
Authors: Habicht, Johanna; Dina, Larisa M; Stylianou, Mona; Harper, Ross; Hauser, Tobias U; Rollwage, Max
Summary: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to treatment. The lack of engagement with therapeutic materials and exercises between sessions is a key determinant of unsuccessful treatment. We tested whether the deployment of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered personalised therapy support tool would lead to improved treatment success.

Title: The Habenula in Mood Disorders: A Scoping Review of Human Studies
Authors: Fortin, Jean-Simon; Lafleur, Mathilde; Parisien, Charles; Hetu, Sebastien
Summary: In animal models, the habenula has been identified as a key structure involved in depression. This scoping review aims to synthesize findings from human studies. We found that the evidence for baseline habenular hyperactivity in human depression is mixed.

Title: Assessing alexithymia for positive and negative emotions: the role of granularity and dialecticism
Authors: MAS, Marine; Luana, Comida; Luminet, Olivier
Summary: Alexithymia is a transdiagnostic factor for the development and maintenance of psychological symptomatology. This study aimed at replicating and extending findings from Aaron et al., 2018. Participants evaluated their emotional experience after watching videos inducing anger, disgust and sadness.

Title: Discriminative Validity and Interpretability of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire
Authors: Mansueto, Sara; Kumar, Rohina; Raitman, Michelle R; Jahagirdar, Anisha; Chen, Sheng; Wang, Wei; Krause, Karolin R; Monga, Suneeta; szatmari, peter; Courtney, Darren
Summary: Using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) to differentiate between depression severity levels remains unexplored. We assessed the discriminative validity of the MFQ to identify an optimal cut-off score. An observational cross-sectional design was used in a sample (N=67) of help-seeking youth.

Summary: Meditation is a family of ancient and contemporary contemplative mind-body practices that can modulate psychological processes, awareness, and mental states. Over the last 40 years, clinical science has manualised meditation practices and designed various meditation interventions (MIs), that have shown therapeutic efficacy for disorders including depression, pain, addiction, and anxiety.

Title: Programming The Mind - The Seven Dimensions of Attachment in Personality and Psychopathology
Authors: Gagliardi, Marcantonio
Summary: This book presents an innovative, comprehensive theoretical framework for Clinical Psychology. Through a cognitive-evolutionary perspective, the theory builds the common ground necessary to integrate contributions from all schools and orientations. The focus is on the individual psychological differences caused by the information stored in a standard, organically healthy brain substrate.
