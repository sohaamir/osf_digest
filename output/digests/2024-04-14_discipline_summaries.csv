Psychiatry,"Title: SAS-1: A single-item smartphone addiction scale
Authors: Olson, Jay A; Langer, Ellen J; Martin, Loren
Summary: Current measures of smartphone addiction are often too long for some contexts, such as large-scale surveys or pilot studies. We tested a single-item measure that probes agreement with the statement: 'I am addicted to my smartphone' Across 7,827 participants aged 18 to 89 from 131 countries, 37% agreed or strongly agreed with this statement.

Title: A psychopathological theory-driven early relapse prediction model using speech and language in psychosis
Authors: Dalal, Tyler C; Park, Min T M; Silva, Angelica; Iskhakova, Svetlana; Voppel, Alban; Brierley, Noah; Mackinley, Michael; Olarewaju, Emmanuel; Palaniyappan, Lena
Summary: Language-based prediction of psychotic relapse using speech-derived markers offers a promising avenue for targeted prevention in early intervention. The sheer number of speech markers and the 'black box' nature of predictive models present significant challenges for clinical translation. Successful real-world predictions require the underlying model to be a 'reasonable facsimile' of the clinical phenomena.

Title: Generative AI-Enabled Therapy Support Tool Improves Clinical Outcomes and Patient Engagement in NHS Talking Therapies
Authors: Habicht, Johanna; Dina, Larisa M; Stylianou, Mona; Harper, Ross; Hauser, Tobias U; Rollwage, Max
Summary: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to treatment. The lack of engagement with therapeutic materials and exercises between sessions is a key determinant of unsuccessful treatment. We tested whether the deployment of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered personalised therapy support tool would lead to improved treatment success.

Summary: Using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) to differentiate between depression severity levels remains unexplored. We assessed the discriminative validity of the MFQ to identify an optimal cut-off score. An observational cross-sectional design was used in a sample (N=67) of help-seeking youth.
