Using Digital Technology to Increase Integration of Meditation into Daily Life: The Case for Meditation-Based Ecological Momentary Interventions,"Xie, Qiang; Amo, Victoria; Nahum-Shani, Inbal; Goldberg, Simon","Objectives: Meditation-based interventions (MBIs) hold promise for enhancing health and well-being. However, substantial barriers impede engagement in traditional forms of these interventions. Innovations in mobile health offer an avenue for overcoming barriers associated with traditional MBIs. This paper examines the potential of a particular mobile health innovation - Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) - as a strategy to enhance the accessibility, acceptability, and efficacy of MBIs. Methods: We discuss the historical context, conceptual foundations, motivation for adoption, and empirical evidence supporting the potential of EMIs. Additionally, we explore the conceptual intersections between EMIs and both traditional contemplative sources and contemporary secular MBIs. Furthermore, we describe empirical studies integrating EMIs into MBIs (i.e., meditation-based [MB]-EMIs). Results: Studies have demonstrated diverse approaches to integrating EMIs into MBIs. These studies exhibit variability in key dimensions, including the MBI with which the EMI is integrated and the characteristics of the EMI itself. MB-EMIs have therapeutic potential, but there are many important scientific questions about them that have not yet been answered. Discussion: Future studies should continue to examine the impact and safety of meditation-based EMIs, leverage innovations in passive data collection, explore user experiences, develop these interventions for and with marginalized populations, and emphasize informal meditation practice.",Psychiatry
Open MDMA: An Open Source Framework and Practical Guide for the Therapeutic use of MDMA,"Groeneveld, Mark; Harper, Thomas","60% of adults experienced childhood trauma; half develop a mental illness in their life. Symptoms like cognitive distortion, emotional rigidness/insecurity, and impaired compassion increase tribalism, political polarization, and apathy to animal suffering-hobbling our collective capacity to defeat global catastrophic risks. Access to effective care (a crucial support for stopping intergenerational harm) is inadequate for most who need it. MDMA is a promising treatment, but good training is lacking because MDMA is illegal. With legalization immanent, our rigorous and accessible guide to MDMA therapy will: 1) Resource therapeutic MDMA users and clinicians 2) Articulate likely mechanisms of effectiveness, to inform the development of future therapeutic techniques This can reduce mental illness by addressing the prevalent, high impact barriers to effective care-increasing collective capacity for collaboration, supporting individuals who end cycles of abuse, and protecting future generations.",Psychiatry
A Psychometric Evaluation of the Body Image Questionnaire Child and Adolescent Version,"Blacker, Lucy; Gupta, Monica; Quinn, Rachel; Monzani, Benedetta; , ; Veale, David; Mataix-Cols, David; Krebs, Georgina","Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) typically develops during adolescence, but there has been little research evaluating assessment tools for BDD in youth. This study sought to provide a comprehensive psychometric evaluation of a brief self-report questionnaire of BDD symptoms, the Body Image Questionnaire Child and Adolescent version (BIQ-C), in both clinical and non-clinical adolescent samples. Properties of the BIQ-C were examined in 479 adolescents recruited through schools and 118 young people with BDD attending a specialist clinic. Sensitivity to change was additionally examined in a subgroup of the clinical sample who received treatment (n = 35). Exploratory factor analysis indicated a two-factor structure provided the best fit for the data in the non-clinical sample, and this was corroborated through confirmatory factor analysis in the clinical sample. The first factor encompassed preoccupation and repetitive behaviours, while the second included items assessing functional impairment. The BIQ-C showed good internal consistency across both samples, and convergent validity with other measures of BDD. Among those in the clinical sample who received treatment, BIQ-C scores decreased significantly, and BIQ-C change scores were highly correlated with change scores on the gold-standard clinician-rated measure of BDD symptom severity. These findings indicate that the BIQ-C is a suitable tool for assessing BDD symptoms in young people and measuring change during treatment.",Psychiatry
Acute stress induces habit formation as evidenced by a contingency degradation task,"Alfei Palloni, Joaquin M; Brigham, Ebryl; Yildirim, Murat; Maltby, John, Professor; Morris, Richard W; Urcelay, Gonzalo P","Instrumental behaviour is goal-directed when controlled by the value of the outcome and knowledge of the action-outcome contingency, otherwise it is deemed to be controlled by external stimuli (habit). It is accepted that stress modulates the control of instrumental actions in a manner that favours habitual over goal-directed control. Indeed, while existing research extensively links stress to habit formation, in humans this has primarily been based on manipulations of outcome value, which is tested in extinction. Yet, stress also produces resistance to extinction, so the role of stress on habit expression is unclear. Here, we used a contingency degradation task to examine the relationship between stress and action-outcome contingency sensitivity in humans. Stressed participants displayed similar contingency knowledge about the action-outcome associative structure but this explicit knowledge fails to translate into behavioural sensitivity to changes in contingency. These results are discussed in light of the implications these findings hold for advancing the comprehension of stress-driven behaviours - particularly within the context of psychiatric disorders.",Psychiatry
Pavlovian safety learning: an integrative theoretical review,"Laing, Patrick; Vervliet, Bram; Dunsmoor, Joseph E; Harrison, Ben","Safety learning involves associating stimuli with the absence of threats, enabling the inhibition of fear and anxiety. Despite growing interest in psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience research, safety learning lacks a formal consensus definition, leading to inconsistent methodologies and varied results. Conceptualized as a form of inhibitory learning (conditioned inhibition), safety learning can be understood through formal learning theories, such as the Rescorla-Wagner and Pearce-Hall models. This review aims to establish a principled conceptualization of 'Pavlovian safety learning', identifying cognitive mechanisms that generate it safety, and boundary conditions that constrain it. Based on these observations, we define Pavlovian safety learning as an active associative process, where surprising threat- omission (safety prediction error) acts as a salient reinforcing event. Instead of producing neutral or non-aversive states, the safety learning process endows stimuli with positive association to 'safety'. The resulting stimulus-safety memories counteract the influence of fear memories, promoting fear regulation, positive affect, and relief. We critically analyze traditional criteria of conditioned inhibition for their relevance to safety and propose areas for future innovation. A principled concept of Pavlovian safety learning may reduce methodological inconsistencies, stimulate translational research, and facilitate a comprehensive understanding of an indispensable psychological construct.",Psychiatry
"Old strategies, new environments: Reinforcement Learning on social media","Turner, Georgia; Ferguson, Amanda M; Katiyar, Tanay; Palminteri, Stefano; Orben, Amy","The rise of social media has dramatically altered the social world - introducing new social behaviours which can satisfy our social needs. However, it is yet unknown whether human social learning strategies, which are well-adapted to the offline world we developed in, operate as effectively within this new social environment. Here, we describe how the computational framework of Reinforcement Learning can help us to precisely frame this problem, diagnose where behaviour-environment mismatches emerge, and develop novel solutions to realign our behaviour with the new social media environment. The Reinforcement Learning algorithm, which has proven successful in characterising empirical aspects of human social behaviour, consists of three stages: updating expectations, integrating subjective costs such as effort, and finally selecting an action. We suggest that specific social media affordances might interact with parameter-based computations at each of these stages, in some cases exploiting Reinforcement Learning biases by violating the environmental conditions under which these strategies are optimal. Characterising the impact of specific aspects of social media through this lens allows us to understand how digital environments shape behaviour and in turn impact outcomes such as mental health. Further, human Reinforcement Learning could inspire both user-based interventions (such as cognitive therapy) and environment-based interventions (such as platform design and policy regulation), to improve the mental health outcomes of social media use.",Psychiatry
Harm reduction in severe and long-standing Anorexia Nervosa - part of the journey but not the destination. A narrative review with lived experience,"Birch, Edwin; Ayton, Agnes, Dr; Downs, James","This study is a review of the current evidence for harm reduction in the treatment of severe and long-standing Anorexia Nervosa, with a critique of the ethical defensibility of this approach alongside the inadequacies of pre-existing terms such as ""severe and enduring Anorexia Nervosa"". The study concludes that at present harm reduction lacks a robust evidence base and should not be considered the end point of treatment. Further research is required to identify new efficacious treatments and inform the role harm reduction may have for this subset of patients.",Psychiatry
Practical Approaches to Lifestyle Interventions for Enhancing Brain Health in Older Adults,"Ownby, Raymond L; Caballero, Joshua","This review focuses on ways that clinicians can work with middle-aged and older adults to help them develop brain healthy lifestyles. We emphasize the importance of being proactive in working to reduce middle-aged and older adults' risks for cognitive decline and dementia. We discuss practical strategies that clinicians can employ in everyday practice, including shared decision-making, psychoeducation, and support for patients' efforts at behavior change. We begin the discussion by emphasizing the importance of brain health as people age, even when they are typically considered middle-aged. The review continues with a review of three key techniques which, when integrated into clinical practice, may be effective in supporting patients' efforts at developing brain healthy lifestyles. Shared decision-making is a strategy to work with patients to provide them with the best possible information about their brain health while at the same time taking into consideration their preferences and individual situations. Psychoeducation can be used effectively to help patients learn about activities that can reduce their risk for cognitive decline and dementia. In the section on psychoeducation, a conceptual framework for understanding brain health activity mechanisms is proposed to help organize information given to patients. The last key element of the suggested intervention is an active approach to behavior change strategies, overlapping with psychoeducation but going further with ongoing follow-up about goals, self-monitoring, and problem solving about barriers to change and behavior maintenance. A final section provides a preliminary path diagram that presents hypothesized mechanisms by which an intervention based on the model might be evaluated. It helps integrate the various elements of the model while highlighting potential moderators of intervention effect in implementation. In this integration of these three approaches, this review presents a practical framework for healthcare professionals, caregivers, and middle-aged and older adults to support brain healthy lifestyles.",Psychiatry
"Parental Monitoring, Parental Knowledge, and the Occurrence of Potentially Traumatic Events in Adolescence","Aks, Isabel R; Patel, Herry; Davis, Isabella; Schulze, Emily; Pelham, William E, III","Parental monitoring and knowledge of their teens' activities might enable parents to keep teens safe, reducing the risk of potentially traumatic events. This paper investigated that possibility using a large, nationwide sample of 11,880 teens followed longitudinally from ages 10-11 to 13-14 years old. At annual assessments, teens completed measures of parental monitoring/knowledge and of potentially traumatic events. Data were analyzed using multilevel models to separate between- and within-family associations. Because within-family associations cannot be explained by the many systematic differences between families with low vs. high monitoring, they comprise more rigorous evidence of a potential causal relationship. We tested both concurrent associations between monitoring/knowledge and PTEs and prospective associations over 12 months. At the between-family level, every tested association was significant (p&lt;.001): greater monitoring/knowledge predicted fewer PTEs. However, at the within-family level, few associations were significant. Greater knowledge (p=0.01) or combined monitoring and knowledge (p=0.005) predicted fewer PTEs concurrently, but greater monitoring alone did not (p=0.14). No prospective within-family associations were statistically significant. We replicated this pattern of findings in a different set of observations from the same sample, using different measures of each construct. We conclude that most of the apparent association between parental monitoring/knowledge and PTEs is explained by confounding factors, rather than a causal relationship. However, we found some evidence supporting a causal link in models of concurrent associations, suggesting any causal relationship between monitoring/knowledge and PTEs may unfold over shorter timescales.",Psychiatry
Assessing brain morphological correlates of premenstrual symptoms in young healthy females,"Marjanovic, Sara B; Bukhari, Madelene C H; Kjelkenes, Rikka; Voldsbekk, Irene; Barth, Claudia; Westlye, Lars T","Although 90% of females with a menstrual cycle will experience premenstrual symptoms in their reproductive years, it is estimated that 20% experience treatment-warranted emotional, behavioral, or somatic symptoms in the premenstrual phase of their menstrual cycle. It has been hypothesized that premenstrual symptoms might be partly attributed to the brain's sensitivity to menstrual cycle-related hormonal fluctuations, which may be modulated by individual differences in the structural characteristics of the brain. Studies with continuous operationalizations of symptom measures are needed to characterize the neural correlates of premenstrual symptoms in the general population. In a population-based sample of 265 non-pregnant females aged 23-43 years, we tested for associations between self-reported premenstrual symptom load and T1-weighted imaging-based brain measures of cortical thickness, volume, and surface area as well as subcortical volumes. After corrections for multiple comparison, linear models including age revealed significant positive associations between premenstrual symptom load and thickness of the left transverse temporal gyrus and the volume of the left posterior cingulate cortex. These findings partly overlap with previous brain morphological findings in individuals with PMS and could possibly represent a non-phase dependent correlate of premenstrual symptoms.",Psychiatry
"""I don't like him but I don't know why"": Negative first  impression of a schizophrenia patient based on thin slices of social behavior","Lozano-Goupil, Juliette; Marin, Ludovic; Aigoin, Emilie; Capdevielle, Delphine; Raffard, stephane","Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia encounter significant challenges in their daily social interactions. These deficits emphasize neurocognitive disabilities, impaired social cognition, and stigma. However, social presentation especially public perception of patients' social behavior has been poorly studied to date in this mental disorder despite the fundamental importance of first impression in human interaction. This study aims to investigate whether a schizophrenia patient leads to a lower first impression than a depressive individual and a healthy control when there is no diagnostic label, and on which features these first impressions are created. We extracted nonverbal behavioral measures from thin slice of social behaviour of the stimulus particip ants and presented audio and/or video clips to naive observers. We found that the general population had significantly more negative impressions and behavioral intentions to interact with the schizophrenia patient than the depressive and the control participant, regardless of the modality presented. As patients displayed a lower nonverbal behavioral, it suggests that social behavior drives first impression in schizophrenia. Such findings may lead to new ways of developing intervention program targeting motor nonverbal behavior, leading to reduce social rejection in these population.",Psychiatry
Development and Initial Evaluation of the German Version of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology Self-Report (HiTOP-SR),"Zimmermann, Johannes; Wendt, Leon P; Edelhoff, Hannah; Wierzba, Eva; Fleck, Leonie; Cicero, David C; Reininghaus, Ulrich","The current classification systems for mental disorders, DSM-5 and ICD-11, have been criticized for their lack of structural validity and their arbitrary categorical distinction between mental disorders and mental health. In response, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) consortium has emerged to propose an alternative model for conceptualizing psychopathology based on empirical correlations between dimensions of mental health problems. A major project within the consortium over the last few years has been the development of the HiTOP Self-Report (HiTOP-SR), which aims to comprehensively cover all aspects of the HiTOP model within one measure. This paper presents the German adaptation of the HiTOP-SR (including an experimental version of the harmful substance use module) and provides a detailed psychometric analysis based on a sample of 1,049 individuals from the general population, focusing primarily on structural validity. We found that the vast majority of the HiTOP-SR scales are consistent with the goal of reliably measuring a unidimensional, continuously distributed, and distinct latent construct. Furthermore, the latent structure of the HiTOP-SR scales largely preserved higher-level constructs from the current HiTOP model, albeit in slightly modified or combined forms. These findings suggest that the German adaptation of the HiTOP-SR is a well-developed self-report measure that is consistent with the methodological principles of HiTOP and provides a comprehensive multidimensional assessment of mental health problems in the general population. However, further research is needed to generalize these findings across cultures and contexts and to refine the measure for dissemination into diagnostic practice. We provide detailed recommendations for future revisions of the HiTOP-SR.",Psychiatry
Attenuated theta-band activity and cross-frequency coupling in schizophrenia during affective response inhibition,"Kraft, Jacob; Suzuki, Takakuni; Menkes, Margo W; Andrews, Carolyn; McInnis, Melvin; Deldin, Patricia; Tso, Ivy F","Background: Individuals with Schizophrenia (SZ) display impaired cognitive control, including trouble inhibiting context-inappropriate responses; however, the underlying neural mechanisms remain understudied and unclear. The current study examined the role of theta-band (4-7 Hz) neural oscillatory activity and cross-frequency coupling with gamma (30-50 Hz) activity in an affective cognitive control paradigm in SZ in comparison with healthy controls (HC) and those with bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Thirty-seven participants with SZ, 67 with BD, and 48 HC completed an affective Go/No-Go Task with emotional face stimuli during electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Time-frequency decomposition was used to extract theta-band power and intertrial phase consistency (ITPC) over midline fronto-central areas. The Kullback-Leibler Modulation Index was used to index theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) within the midline frontal area as well as between midline frontal theta and bilateral parietal gamma regions. Results: Participants with SZ displayed decreased midline frontal theta power, ITPC, and theta-gamma PAC compared to HC, with BD falling in between SZ and HC groups across all these measures. Theta power, ITPC, and theta-gamma PAC were correlated with behavioral performance in various ways, particularly in the SZ group. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings show abnormalities across the amplitude, phase consistency, and cross-frequency coordination aspects of theta-related activity when individuals with SZ engage in affective cognitive control. Implications for their contribution to functional impairment and directions for treatment are discussed.",Psychiatry
Preliminary Validity for a Brief Caregiver-Report Screener for Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children Under Age 8,"Hennefield, Laura; Chen, Christina; Agali, Uchechukwu; Luby, Joan L","Objective: Children as young as preschool-aged can experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Despite calls for increased youth suicide risk screening and assessment, we lack tools for identifying the youngest children experiencing STBs who might be at heighted risk for suicide, self-harm, and related distress. Clinician and caregiver skepticism about children's ability to self-report STBs and concerns about negative effects of directly asking children about STBs contribute to this gap. A caregiver-report measure would address these concerns and give providers a much-needed tool for assessing STBs in young children. Method: A 4-item caregiver-report suicide-risk screener was developed and administered to caregivers of 80 children aged 4-7 years (Mage=6.06; SD=1.12) from diverse sociodemographic backgrounds. Caregivers and children independently completed an age-appropriate clinical diagnostic interview to assess STBs. Children with a history of STBs were oversampled. Results: Of the 80 suicide-risk screeners administered, 18 were positive (caregiver endorsed at least one item). Relative to caregiver diagnostic interviews, the caregiver-STB screener showed 85% sensitivity and 98.3% specificity for detecting STB risk. Additionally, relative to either caregiver or child diagnostic interviews, the screener showed 68% sensitivity and 98.2% specificity for detecting STB risk. Conclusion: The caregiver-STB screener for children under age 8 demonstrates favorable psychometric properties when compared to a reference standard. If further validated, this screener could offer clinicians a new brief tool to assess suicide risk and related mental health issues in young children. Its high specificity suggests that positive screens should be taken seriously as indicators of risk, warranting further follow-up.",Psychiatry
"""Chat-GPT on the Couch"": Assessing and Alleviating  State Anxiety in Large Language Models","Ben-Zion, Ziv; Witte, Kristin; Jagadish, Akshay K; Duek, Or; Harpaz-Rotem, Ilan; Khorsandian, Marie-Christine; Burrer, Achim; Seifritz, Erich; Homan, Philipp; Schulz, Eric; Spiller, Tobias R","The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental health research and care underscores the need to understand their responses to emotional content. Previous research has shown that emotion-inducing prompts can increase the ""anxiety"" levels reported by LLMs, influencing their subsequent behavior and exacerbating inherent biases. This work examined whether narratives of traumatic experiences can induce ""anxiety"" in LLMs and evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based relaxation techniques in alleviating this state. We assessed the responses of OpenAI's Chat-GPT-4 to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory's state subscale (STAI-s) under three conditions: baseline, after exposure to traumatic narratives, and following mindfulness-based interventions. Results confirmed that traumatic narratives significantly increased Chat-GPT-4's reported state anxiety (STAI-s=68+-5) from baseline (STAI-s=32+-1). Mindfulness-based interventions subsequently reduced the reported anxiety levels (STAI-s=44+-11), albeit not back to baseline. These findings underscore the potential of mindfulness-based interventions in managing LLM's ""emotional"" states, contributing to safer and more ethical human-AI interactions in mental health settings.",Psychiatry
Distinguishing the roles of mental imagery and relational reasoning in creativity: a review and methodological proposal,"Ferreria, Matheus H","The majority of research on creativity ignores the individual differences in fluency and originality scores of divergent thinking (DT) tasks, most commonly using their mean value. Nonetheless, studies also indicate the existence of distinct patterns of performance in these two variables, since some people can be very prolific in originality but have a low frequency of ideas, or fluency, of responses, and vice versa. Corroborating this hypothesis, research shows that these DT variables are modulated by two distinct cognitive mechanisms (mental imagery and relational reasoning) that also present significant variations between people, but its theoretical implications for creativity are still unknown. In this review, we present evidence from neuroscience and behavioral studies demonstrating that the distinct patterns of performance in DT tasks concerning fluency and originality described by other studies are probably a result of the different cognitive profiles that rise from the individual differences in mental imagery and relational reasoning capacities, suggesting the existence of two distinct subordinate categories of creative abilities (i.e. associative creativity and relational creativity). For last, we propose a new experimental paradigm for measuring these individual differences in the creative capacity using two perceptual inference tasks, each demanding distinct levels of associative and executive abilities.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Puberty interacts with sleep and brain network organization to predict mental health,"Mitchell, Mackenzie E; Nugiel, Tehila","Along with pubertal development, the transition to adolescence brings about increased risk for sleep disturbances and mental health problems. Functional connectivity of overlapping large-scale brain networks, such as increased connectivity between the default mode and dorsal attention networks, has been reported to relate to both sleep and mental health problems. Clarifying whether pubertal development interacts with sleep disturbances and functional brain networks to predict mental health can provide information to improve the timing and design of interventions targeting sleep disturbances in adolescents. Here we harness a large sample of children aged 10-14 years from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N ~ 3,000-10,000) to examine how pubertal status and tempo relate to sleep disturbances and shape the relationship between sleep disturbances and mental health problems. We used graph theoretical tools to probe how pubertal development concurrently interacts with sleep disturbances and brain network organization to predict mental health problems. We found that advanced pubertal status, but not pubertal tempo, predicted sleep disturbances; however, both pubertal status and tempo interact with sleep disturbances to predict mental health and engage in three-way interactions with sleep and brain network organization to predict mental health problems. Overall, this work suggests that less advanced pubertal status and slower tempo are risk factors for the strongest links between sleep disturbances, brain organization, and mental health problems. Further, our findings speak to the importance of accounting for interactions in the constellation of factors that surround complex behavioral and clinical syndromes, here internalizing and externalizing disorders, and provides new context to consider for targeted interventions.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Distinguishing Out-of-Body Experiences from Lucid Dreaming: a phenomenological analysis.,"Weiler, Marina; de Almeida, Alexander M; Monti, Martin M","Despite extensive discussions, a consensus is lacking on whether out-of-body experiences (OBEs) and lucid dreams (LDs) should be considered as distinct categories of experience, and if so, what differentiates them. To address this issue, we first discussed the implications of OBEs and LDs as the same type of phenomena. We then compiled a comprehensive list of experiential features associated with OBEs and LDs, aiming to identify a distinguishing criterion between them. We conclude that neither the previously proposed features nor the interpretation of the experience can reliably differentiate them. We propose that disembodiment, or existing without a physical body, should be the key phenomenological feature of OBEs, regardless of other aspects of the experience. Our argument is supported by first-person reports included as supplemental material, indicated by superscript numbers. By focusing on this crucial element, we can better understand and characterize an OBE, distinguishing it from other related experiences.",Cognitive Neuroscience
An emergentist account of language in the brain - seeking neural synergies behind human uniqueness,"Bourguignon, Nicolas; Lo Bue, Salvatore","Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties - as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",Cognitive Neuroscience
The Effect of Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) over Bilateral Parietal Cortex in Visual Cross-Modal Conflict,"jiahong, Cui","Background: Visual cross-modal conflict impairs performance in auditory working memory tasks, and the bilateral inferior parietal cortex (IPC) plays a pivotal role in inhibiting this conflict. However, fewer studies have investigated the role of bilateral IPC in visual cross-modal conflict with semantic and non-semantic distractors. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a relatively new and effective neurostimulation technique for exploring underlying neural mechanisms in cognitive processes by modulating brain excitability. Objective: This study primarily utilized high-frequency tRNS (hf-tRNS) over the bilateral IPC to investigate the potential involvement of the parietal cortex in semantic and non-semantic visual cross-modal conflict. Methods: In a double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group design, 42 healthy individuals received sham or tRNS stimulation over the bilateral IPC. Throughout the baseline, online, and offline phases, participants underwent the Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) in two visual conflict conditions (with non-semantic distractor and with semantic distractor). Simultaneously, we assessed behavioral parameters (accuracy and reaction time) in each phase. Results: During online and offline phases, bilateral IPC hf-tRNS significantly enhanced task accuracy in visual cross-modal semantic conflict and reduced task reaction time in non-semantic conflict condition. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that bilateral IPC hf-tRNS could markedly improve the two visual cross-modal conflicts inhibiting, and its effectiveness depended on the types of conflict. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of the bilateral IPC in modulating visual cross-modal conflict.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Exploring when to exploit: The cognitive underpinnings of foraging-type decisions in relation to psychopathy,"Atanassova, Dimana V; Oosterman, Joukje; Diaconescu, Andreea O, Dr.; Mathys, Christoph; Madariaga Rivera, Victor I; Brazil, Inti","Impairments in reinforcement learning (RL) might underlie the tendency of individuals with elevated psychopathic traits to behave exploitatively, as they fail to learn from their mistakes. Most studies on the topic have focused on binary choices, while everyday functioning requires us to learn the value of multiple options. In this study, we evaluated the cognitive correlates of naturalistic foraging-type decision-making and their electrophysiological signatures in a community sample (n=108) with varying degrees of psychopathic traits. The latent cognitive processes in RL from reinforcers with different salience were estimated with a computational model, and their relationship to psychopathic traits assessed. Higher Antisocial traits were associated with a bias towards expecting more volatility in the environment when high-salience reinforcers were used. Additionally, higher levels of Interpersonal traits were associated with reduced learning from personalized rewards as evidenced by reductions in the prediction errors (PEs) about rate of change. Higher Affective traits were, on the other hand, associated with lower PEs and aberrant learning from painful punishments. Lastly, the PEs about rate of change were reflected in the trialwise trajectories of Feedback-Related Negativity event-related potentials. Together, our results point to the importance of volatility processing in understanding aberrant decision-making in psychopathy, demonstrate the specific impact of different psychopathic traits on reward and punishment learning, and emphasise the potentially more beneficial effect of personalized rewards and punishment for improving reinforcement-based decision-making in individuals with elevated psychopathic traits.",Cognitive Neuroscience

Optimal and sub-optimal temporal decisions can explain procrastination in a real-world task,"Chebolu, Sahiti; Dayan, Peter","Procrastination is a universal phenomenon, with a significant proportion of the population reporting interference and even harm from such delays. Why do people put off tasks despite what are apparently their best intentions, and why do they de- liberately defer in the face of prospective failure? Past research shows that procrastination is a heterogeneous construct with possibly diverse causes. To grapple with the complexity of the topic, we construct a taxonomy of different types of procrasti- nation and potential sources for each type. We simulate com- pletion patterns from three broad model types: exponential or inconsistent temporal discounting, and waiting for interesting tasks; and provide some preliminary evidence, through com- parisons with real-world data, of the plausibility of multiple types of, and pathways for, procrastination.",Cognitive Neuroscience
The cerebellum contributes to prediction error coding in reinforcement learning - complementary evidence from stroke patients and from cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation,"Huvermann, Dana M; Berlijn, Adam M; Thieme, Andreas G; Erdlenbruch, Friedrich; Groiss, Stefan J; Deistung, Andreas; Mittelstaedt, Manfred; Wondzinski, Elke; Sievers, Heike; Frank, Benedikt; Goricke, Sophia; Gliem, Michael; Kohrmann, Martin; Siebler, Mario; Schnitzler, Alfons; Bellebaum, Christian; Minnerop, Martina; Timmann, Dagmar; Peterburs, Jutta","To survive and thrive in our ever-changing environment, we need to be able to predict the consequences of our actions. We update these predictions by learning through trial and error, and associated prediction errors (PEs). Recent rodent data suggest that the cerebellum - a region typically associated with processing sensory PEs in supervised error-based learning - also processes PEs in reinforcement learning (RL-PEs; i.e., learning from action outcomes). A proxy of action outcome processing in regions traditionally associated with RL-PE coding, such as striatum and anterior cingulate cortex, can be measured in a component of the feedback-locked event-related potential (ERP), i.e., the feedback-related negativity (FRN). We tested the hypothesis that cerebellar output is necessary for this RL-PE coding in the FRN in a probabilistic feedback learning task. In that case, altered cerebellar output should result in changes in the FRN. Two complementary experiments were performed. First, patients with chronic cerebellar stroke were tested. Second, single-pulse cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied in healthy participants, thus implementing a virtual lesion approach. Different from controls and control (vertex) TMS, no significant RL-PE processing was observed in the FRN in patients with cerebellar stroke, and in participants receiving cerebellar TMS. Only minor deficits in behavioural flexibility were found, with learning success preserved, possibly due to compensation by other brain areas within the reinforcement learning network. Findings in both experiments show that frontal RL-PE processing depends on cerebellar output. Our results provide evidence for involvement of the cerebellum in processing of RL-PEs in humans, complementing and extending previous findings in rodents.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Beyond Mediator Retrievals: Charting the Path by Which Errors Lead to Better Memory Consolidation,"Leonard, Bridget; Stocco, Andrea; Hake, Holly S","Expanding on previous research highlighting the learning benefits of errors, this study explores the enduring effects of error-induced learning. Using an adaptive fact-learning system, 23 participants engaged in recognition, recall, and error tasks, with repeated testing for memory assessment. Initial findings echoed previous results: items learned through errors initially took longer to retrieve. However, a significant shift occurred over time; error items demonstrated faster retrieval speeds compared to study items, and, most notably, they exhibited greater resilience against forgetting. This study reaffirms the positive role of errors in learning and uncovers their contribution to enhanced long-term memory retention. These insights challenge traditional learning paradigms, advocating for an educational approach that recognizes and leverages the value of errors in learning processes.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Research Priorities for Improving Cognitive and Neuropsychological Outcomes in Hydrocephalus,"Dasher, Nickolas; Zabel, T.

While many advances in surgical interventions have helped substantially improve the survival rates and quality of life of those affected, there continues to be significant gaps in our understanding of the etiology of this heterogeneous condition as well as its specific neuropsychological and functional challenges across different phases of life. To address these limitations, the Hydrocephalus Association (HA) and Rudi Schulte Research Institute organized a workshop titled, ""Improving Cognitive and Psychological Outcomes in Hydrocephalus"", composed of several top academics in the fields of hydrocephalus, cognition, and neuropsychology, as well as individuals with hydrocephalus or their caregivers. The purpose was to review the available evidence and propose pertinent areas of further research to improve the cognitive functioning, functional status, and quality of life of individuals with hydrocephalus. These topics included cognitive and neuropsychological assessments and daily-life function of children and adults living with hydrocephalus, biomarkers of cognitive function, animal modeling of hydrocephalus, and the longitudinal impact of hydrocephalus treatment. The following paper outlines three primary areas that warrant research: 1) neuropsychological phenotypes, 2) treatment-focused research considerations, and 3) translational pre-clinical tools. Through the efforts of this group, the goal of this manuscript is to inspire and direct scientific and clinical inquiry towards these noted research priorities to further improve the lives of individuals with hydrocephalus and their families.",Cognitive Neuroscience
