Psychiatry,Using Digital Technology to Increase Integration of Meditation into Daily Life: The Case for Meditation-Based Ecological Momentary Interventions,"Xie, Qiang; Amo, Victoria; Nahum-Shani, Inbal; Goldberg, Simon", meditation-based interventions hold promise for enhancing health and well-being. Innovations in mobile health offer an avenue for overcoming barriers associated with traditional MBIs. This paper examines the potential of a particular mobile health innovation - Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs)
Psychiatry,Open MDMA: An Open Source Framework and Practical Guide for the Therapeutic use of MDMA,"Groeneveld, Mark; Harper, Thomas","60% of adults experienced childhood trauma; half develop a mental illness in their life. Access to effective care (a crucial support for stopping intergenerational harm) is inadequate. MDMA is a promising treatment, but good training is lacking because MDMA is illegal."
Psychiatry,A Psychometric Evaluation of the Body Image Questionnaire Child and Adolescent Version,"Blacker, Lucy; Gupta, Monica; Quinn, Rachel; Monzani, Benedetta; , ; Veale, David; Mataix-Cols, David; Krebs, Georgina",Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) typically develops during adolescence. There has been little research evaluating assessment tools for BDD in youth. This study sought to provide a comprehensive psychometric evaluation of a brief self-report questionnaire of BDD symptoms.
Psychiatry,Acute stress induces habit formation as evidenced by a contingency degradation task,"Alfei Palloni, Joaquin M; Brigham, Ebryl; Yildirim, Murat; Maltby, John, Professor; Morris, Richard W; Urcelay, Gonzalo P","Stress modulates the control of instrumental actions in a manner that favours habitual over goal-directed control. Yet, stress also produces resistance to extinction, so the role of stress on habit expression is unclear. We used a contingency degradation task to examine the relationship between stress and action-outcome contingency sensitivity in humans."
Psychiatry,Pavlovian safety learning: an integrative theoretical review,"Laing, Patrick; Vervliet, Bram; Dunsmoor, Joseph E; Harrison, Ben","Safety learning involves associating stimuli with the absence of threats, enabling the inhibition of fear and anxiety. Conceptualized as a form of inhibitory learning (conditioned inhibition), safety learning can be understood through formal learning theories."
Psychiatry,"Old strategies, new environments: Reinforcement Learning on social media","Turner, Georgia; Ferguson, Amanda M; Katiyar, Tanay; Palminteri, Stefano; Orben, Amy","The rise of social media has dramatically altered the social world. However, it is yet unknown whether human social learning strategies operate as effectively within this new social environment. Here, we describe how the computational framework of Reinforcement Learning can help us to precisely frame this problem."
Psychiatry,Harm reduction in severe and long-standing Anorexia Nervosa - part of the journey but not the destination. A narrative review with lived experience,"Birch, Edwin; Ayton, Agnes, Dr; Downs, James",This study is a review of the current evidence for harm reduction in the treatment of severe and long-standing Anorexia Nervosa. The study concludes that at present harm reduction lacks a robust evidence base and should not be considered the end point of treatment.
Psychiatry,Practical Approaches to Lifestyle Interventions for Enhancing Brain Health in Older Adults,"Ownby, Raymond L; Caballero, Joshua",This review focuses on ways that clinicians can work with middle-aged and older adults to help them develop brain healthy lifestyles. We emphasize the importance of being proactive in working to reduce risks for cognitive decline and dementia. We discuss practical strategies that Clinicians can employ in everyday practice.
Psychiatry,"Parental Monitoring, Parental Knowledge, and the Occurrence of Potentially Traumatic Events in Adolescence","Aks, Isabel R; Patel, Herry; Davis, Isabella; Schulze, Emily; Pelham, William E, III","A large, nationwide sample of 11,880 teens followed longitudinally from ages 10-11 to 13-14 years old. At annual assessments, teens completed measures of parental monitoring/knowledge and of potentially traumatic events. At the between-family level, every tested association was significant."
Psychiatry,Assessing brain morphological correlates of premenstrual symptoms in young healthy females,"Marjanovic, Sara B; Bukhari, Madelene C H; Kjelkenes, Rikka; Voldsbekk, Irene; Barth, Claudia; Westlye, Lars T","90% of females with a menstrual cycle will experience premenstrual symptoms in their reproductive years. 20% experience treatment-warranted emotional, behavioral, or somatic symptoms in the premanstrual phase of their menstrual cycle. The brain's sensitivity to menstrual cycle-related hormonal fluctuations may be modulated by individual differences."
Psychiatry,"""I don't like him but I don't know why"": Negative first  impression of a schizophrenia patient based on thin slices of social behavior","Lozano-Goupil, Juliette; Marin, Ludovic; Aigoin, Emilie; Capdevielle, Delphine; Raffard, stephane",Social presentation especially public perception of patients' social behavior has been poorly studied to date in this mental disorder. This study aims to investigate whether a schizophrenia patient leads to a lower first impression.
Psychiatry,Development and Initial Evaluation of the German Version of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology Self-Report (HiTOP-SR),"Zimmermann, Johannes; Wendt, Leon P; Edelhoff, Hannah; Wierzba, Eva; Fleck, Leonie; Cicero, David C; Reininghaus, Ulrich",The current classification systems for mental disorders have been criticized for their lack of structural validity. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) consortium has emerged to propose an alternative model for conceptualizing psychopathology.
Psychiatry,Attenuated theta-band activity and cross-frequency coupling in schizophrenia during affective response inhibition,"Kraft, Jacob; Suzuki, Takakuni; Menkes, Margo W; Andrews, Carolyn; McInnis, Melvin; Deldin, Patricia; Tso, Ivy F"," Individuals with Schizophrenia display impaired cognitive control, including trouble inhibiting context-inappropriate responses. The underlying neural mechanisms remain understudied and unclear. The current study examined the role of theta-band (4-7 Hz) neural oscillatory activity and cross-frequency coupling with gamma (30-50 Hz) activity in an affective cognitive control paradigm."
Psychiatry,Preliminary Validity for a Brief Caregiver-Report Screener for Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children Under Age 8,"Hennefield, Laura; Chen, Christina; Agali, Uchechukwu; Luby, Joan L","Children as young as preschool-aged can experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Despite calls for increased youth suicide risk screening and assessment, we lack tools for identifying the youngest children experiencing STBs who might be at heighted risk for suicide, self-harm, and related distress."
Psychiatry,"""Chat-GPT on the Couch"": Assessing and Alleviating  State Anxiety in Large Language Models","Ben-Zion, Ziv; Witte, Kristin; Jagadish, Akshay K; Duek, Or; Harpaz-Rotem, Ilan; Khorsandian, Marie-Christine; Burrer, Achim; Seifritz, Erich; Homan, Philipp; Schulz, Eric; Spiller, Tobias R","The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental health research underscores the need to understand their responses to emotional content. Previous research has shown that emotion-inducing prompts can increase the ""anxiety"" levels reported by LLMs. This work examined whether narratives of traumatic experiences can induce ""an anxiety"" in LLMs and evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based relaxation techniques."
Cognitive Neuroscience,Distinguishing the roles of mental imagery and relational reasoning in creativity: a review and methodological proposal,"Ferreria, Matheus H","The majority of research on creativity ignores the individual differences in fluency and originality scores of divergent thinking (DT) tasks. Some people can be very prolific in originality but have a low frequency of ideas, or fluency, of responses."
Cognitive Neuroscience,Puberty interacts with sleep and brain network organization to predict mental health,"Mitchell, Mackenzie E; Nugiel, Tehila",The transition to adolescence brings about increased risk for sleep disturbances and mental health problems. Clarifying whether pubertal development interacts with sleep disturbances can provide information to improve the timing and design of interventions targeting sleep disturbances.
Cognitive Neuroscience,Distinguishing Out-of-Body Experiences from Lucid Dreaming: a phenomenological analysis.,"Weiler, Marina; de Almeida, Alexander M; Monti, Martin M","A consensus is lacking on whether out-of-body experiences (OBEs) and lucid dreams (LDs) should be considered as distinct categories of experience. We propose that disembodiment, or existing without a physical body, should be the key phenomenological feature of OBEs. By focusing on this crucial element, we can better understand and characterize an OBE."
Cognitive Neuroscience,An emergentist account of language in the brain - seeking neural synergies behind human uniqueness,"Bourguignon, Nicolas; Lo Bue, Salvatore","Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language."
Cognitive Neuroscience,The Effect of Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) over Bilateral Parietal Cortex in Visual Cross-Modal Conflict,"jiahong, Cui",The bilateral inferior parietal cortex (IPC) plays a pivotal role in inhibiting this conflict. Few studies have investigated the role of bilateral IPC in visual cross-modal conflict with semantic and non-semantic distractors. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a relatively new and effective neurostimulation technique for exploring underlying neural mechanisms.
Cognitive Neuroscience,Exploring when to exploit: The cognitive underpinnings of foraging-type decisions in relation to psychopathy,"Atanassova, Dimana V; Oosterman, Joukje; Diaconescu, Andreea O, Dr.; Mathys, Christoph; Madariaga Rivera, Victor I; Brazil, Inti",Impairments in reinforcement learning might underlie the tendency of individuals with elevated psychopathic traits to behave exploitatively. Everyday functioning requires us to learn the value of multiple options. Higher Antisocial traits were associated with a bias towards expecting more volatility in the environment.
Cognitive Neuroscience,Pavlovian safety learning: an integrative theoretical review,"Laing, Patrick; Vervliet, Bram; Dunsmoor, Joseph E; Harrison, Ben","Safety learning involves associating stimuli with the absence of threats, enabling the inhibition of fear and anxiety. Conceptualized as a form of inhibitory learning (conditioned inhibition), safety learning can be understood through formal learning theories."
Cognitive Neuroscience,Optimal and sub-optimal temporal decisions can explain procrastination in a real-world task,"Chebolu, Sahiti; Dayan, Peter","Procrastination is a universal phenomenon, with a significant proportion of the population reporting interference and even harm from such delays. We construct a taxonomy of different types of procrasti- nation and potential sources for each type."
