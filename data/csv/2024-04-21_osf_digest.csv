How visual experience shapes body representation,"Shahzad, Iqra; Occelli, Valeria; Giraudet, Eleonore; Azanon, Elena; Longo, Matthew; Moruaux, Andre; Collignon, Olivier","We do not have a veridical representation of our body in our mind. For instance, tactile distances of equal measure along the medial-lateral axis of our limbs are generally perceived as larger than those running along the proximal-distal axis. This anisotropy in tactile distances reflects distortions in body-shape representation, such that the body parts are perceived as wider than they are. While the origin of such anisotropy remains unknown, it has been suggested that visual experience could partially play a role in its manifestation. To causally test the role of visual experience on body shape representation, we investigated tactile distance perception in sighted and early blind individuals comparing medial-lateral and proximal-distal tactile distances of stimuli presented on the ventral and dorsal part of the forearm, wrist, and hand. Overestimation of distances in the medial-lateral over proximal-distal body axes were found in both sighted and blind people, but the magnitude of the anisotropy was significantly reduced in the forearms of blind people. We conclude that tactile distance perception is mediated by similar mechanisms in both sighted and blind people, but that visual experience can modulate the tactile distance anisotropy.",Psychiatry
Towards understanding and halting legacies of trauma,"Taylor, William; Korobkova, Laura; Bhinderwala, Nabeel; Dias, Brian G","Echoes of natural and anthropogenic traumas not only reverberate within the physiology, biology, and neurobiology of the generation directly exposed to them but also within the biology of future generations. With the intent of understanding this phenomenon, significant efforts have sought to establish multi-generational legacies of experiences like stress, chemical exposures, nutritional impoverishment, and chemosensory experiences. From these studies, we are gaining new appreciation for how legacies of trauma come to be bequeathed to future generations. This review first outlines principles that merit attention in the study of multi-generational legacies of trauma. Next, it discusses causes and consequences that allow for such legacies to perpetuate across generations. Finally, we discuss silver linings of such legacies and how legacies of flourishing can be engineered. In summary, this review synthesizes our current understanding of the concept, causes and consequences of legacies of trauma and looks to opportunities to halt them.",Psychiatry
Suicide ideation severity predicts reduced oculomotor avoidance of suicide-related stimuli,"Sherifi, Emilia; Rowe, Megan; Armstrong, Thomas; Stewart, Jeremy G","Introduction: Identifying variables linked to distinct suicide outcomes has long been among suicidology's research priorities. Cognitive theories of suicide identify attentional processes that may vary for individuals at greater suicide risk. However, an overreliance on self-report and objective measures that are poor estimates of attention have led to mixed findings. Method: The current study utilizes eye-tracking with a novel passive viewing task to explore differences in viewing patterns for suicide- and neutral-image pairings, as a function of suicide outcomes. Young adults (N = 124, 83.9% women) were oversampled for recent suicidal thoughts and behaviours and completed a series of self-report questionnaires specific to suicide history, as well as relevant covariates prior to completing the eye-tracking task. Results: Multi-level modeling revealed that individuals with low to moderate ratings of past year ideation displayed a significant decline in the amount of time spent viewing suicide images as compared to neutral images over the course of the task. However, this same pattern was not seen among individuals with high suicide ideation, and specifically resolved plans and preparation, a subtype of suicide ideation. Furthermore, no differences were found between people with and without a suicide attempt history. Conclusion: These results suggest a suicide-specific disengagement bias among individuals high in suicide ideation, and more specifically resolved plans and preparation.",Psychiatry
Real-time antecedents and correlates of functional neurological symptoms in daily life:  A pilot remote monitoring technology study,"Pick, Susannah; Millman, L. S. Merritt; Hodsoll, John; Stanton, Biba; David, Anthony S; Edwards, Mark J; Goldstein, Laura H; Mehta, Mitul; Nicholson, Timothy; Reinders, A.A.T.S.; Winston, Joel S; Chalder, Trudie; Hotopf, Matthew","Remote monitoring technologies (RMT) could provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying functional neurological symptoms (FNS). We examined the feasibility and acceptability of a novel RMT protocol, aiming to identify psychobiological correlates and antecedents of FNS in everyday life. Seventeen individuals with FNS (seizures/motor) and 17 healthy controls (HC) completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) eight times daily for 1-week, reporting FNS severity, associated physical and psychological symptoms, and subjectively significant events. Sleep quality was reported daily. Fitbit Charge 5s measured objective physiological variables. Multilevel modelling examined variables associated with FNS variability. EMA completion rates were high (>=80%). At week-level, the FNS group reported significantly elevated subjective arousal, pain, fatigue, dissociation, negative affect, daily events, stressful events, and sleep duration, compared to HC. Objective sleep disturbance and duration, and resting heartrate, were also significantly greater in the FNS sample. FNS severity correlated significantly with daily events, affect, subjective arousal, pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance, at day- or within-day levels. Daily events and negative affect temporally predicted momentary FNS severity. RMTs are feasible and acceptable tools for investigation of FNS in real-world settings, revealing daily events and negative affect as possible triggers of FNS. Larger-scale, longer-term RMT studies are needed in FND.",Psychiatry
Anxiety symptom trajectories across development: risk factors and outcomes,"Palaiologou, Elisavet; Skelton, Megan; Assary, Elham; Breen, Gerome; Hotopf, Matthew; Morneau-Vaillancourt, Genevieve; Thompson, Ellen J; Lockhart, Celestine L; McGregor, Thomas; Plomin, Robert; Carr, Ewan; Eley, Thalia C","Background: Anxiety is one of the most common conditions affecting young people. The onset and course of symptoms are highly variable across development and if left untreated, can lead to poor outcomes. We modelled trajectories of anxiety symptoms from childhood to early adulthood and examined associated predictors and adult outcomes. Method: We analysed data from the Twins Early Development Study, a UK-based longitudinal twin cohort (N = 13,965). Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire from ages 4 to 26. Growth mixture modelling was used to identify anxiety symptom trajectories. We examined associations between trajectory class membership and genetic, early life family environment factors and child characteristics, as well as adult outcomes at age 26. Findings: We identified four anxiety symptom trajectories: Low Stable (n=9,440, 68%), Adolescent-Onset (n=2,486, 18%), Childhood-Limited (n=1,583, 11%) and Persistent (n=456, 3%). Neuroticism polygenic score, maternal depression, female sex, early conduct, and peer problems were associated with membership in all three of the smaller, higher severity, anxiety symptom classes. Female sex, conduct and peer problems distinguished these three classes from one another. The Childhood-Limited and Persistent classes were additionally associated with household chaos; Adolescent-Onset anxiety with general cognitive ability and polygenic scores for Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; and Persistent anxiety with polygenic score for Anxiety Disorder. In terms of outcomes, Persistent and Adolescent-Onset trajectories were associated with poor clinical and life outcomes in early adulthood. Interpretation: The developmental course of anxiety is associated with polygenic risk for psychopathology, the early family environment, and child characteristics, with some associations differing between trajectory groups. Screening for high Neuroticism polygenic score, maternal depression, general cognitive ability, and conduct and peer problems may enable the early identification of those at risk of developing anxiety.",Psychiatry
A Neurocognitive Framework for Psychedelics as Learning Opportunities,"Mattek, Sonny","Existing neurocognitive theories have mainly concentrated on the disruptive aspects of psychedelics, such as cognitive disruption, cortical-thalamic filtering disturbances, and disordered/entropic brain states, but they fail to fully account for the emergence of new beneficial behaviors, responses, and insights. This paper proposes a novel framework that shifts the focus from the disruptive aspects of serotonergic psychedelics to their potential as learning opportunities via the engagement of basic neurobiological learning mechanisms. We propose that serotonergic psychedelics promote new beneficial outcomes by activating the orienting response, mediated by the noradrenergic system. The orienting response, which organically occurs only in response to highly compelling and biologically relevant circumstances, leads to psychological and neurophysiological features characteristic of serotonergic psychedelic states. Additionally, there is evidence demonstrating the impact of serotonergic psychedelics on both classic orienting behavior and noradrenergic functioning. The orienting response disrupts ongoing neurocognitive processes to re-order attentional resources according to what is salient in the moment, thus harnessing the plasticity of the nervous system to generate adaptive responses based on learning new associations in real time. Framing psychedelic states as learning opportunities has implications for various aspects of therapeutic practice, including preparation, set and setting, dosage, and outcome measurement. For example, a minimum effective dose might vary depending on therapeutically relevant learning goals. We propose that this perspective can expand the therapeutic possibilities for serotonergic psychedelics, ultimately improving the ability to facilitate positive therapeutic outcomes.",Psychiatry
Risky decision-making and nonsuicidal self-injury among young adults: Examining the role of criticism feedback,"Nancekivell, Brooke; Martin, Lily; Jacobson, Jill A; Allen, Kenneth J D (; Stewart, Jeremy G","Risky decision-making putatively contributes to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) yet empirical support for this association is inconsistent. Studies have not simulated socioemotional contexts most closely linked to NSSI, which may partially explain mixed findings. Accordingly, we examined the association between NSSI and risky decision-making following the receipt of criticism from a close other, a key interpersonal context. The study included 286 university students (Mage = 21.11) oversampled for a lifetime history of NSSI. Participants completed a modified Iowa Gambling Task, in which they chose to play or pass on ""good"" and ""bad"" decks associated with monetary gains and losses. Participants also completed the Criticism Gambling Task, which was identical to the Iowa Gambling Task except critical audio comments preceded each block of trials. Based on results of multilevel growth curve analyses, decreases in risky decision-making were steeper on the Iowa Gambling Task compared to the Criticism Gambling Task, suggesting poorer learning in the context of criticism. Further, how past-month NSSI was related to changes in risky decision-making across blocks differed between the two tasks, b = -0.004, t(3140.00) = 2.48, p = .013. On the Iowa Gambling Task, all participants decreased their risky decision-making; whereas on the Criticism Gambling Task, higher past-month NSSI frequencies were associated with riskier decision-making. Our findings support associations between risky decision-making and NSSI in negative socioemotional contexts, consistent with functional models of NSSI.",Psychiatry
Metacognitive biases in anxious-depression and compulsivity extend across perception and memory,"Seow, Tricia X F; Fleming, Stephen M; Hauser, Tobias U","Metacognitive biases are characteristic of common mental health disorders like depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, recent transdiagnostic approaches consistently contradict traditional clinical studies, with overconfidence in perception among highly compulsive individuals versus underconfident memory in OCD patients. To reconcile these differences, we investigated whether these metacognitive divergences arise due to cognitive domain-specific effects, comorbid overshadowing effects, and/or different manifestations at disparate levels of a metacognitive hierarchy. Using a transdiagnostic individual differences approach (N=327), we quantified metacognitive patterns across memory and perception. Across cognitive domains, we found that underconfidence was linked to anxious-depression and overconfidence was linked to compulsivity. These associations varied across the confidence hierarchy, with anxious-depression being predominantly explained by global low self-esteem, whereas compulsivity exhibited more specific alterations at lower metacognitive levels. Our results support a domain-general alteration of metacognition in psychopathology, with differential contributions from distinct levels of a metacognitive hierarchy, akin to an overshadowing effect.",Psychiatry
The role of social deprivation and cannabis use in explaining variation in the incidence of psychotic disorders: findings from the EU-GEI study,"Brink, Vera E; Andleeb, Humma; van Os, Jim; Quattrone, Diego; Jones, Peter B; Di Forti, Marta; Jongsma, Hannah; Kirkbride, James B","Background and Hypothesis: Recent findings suggest the incidence of first episode psychotic disorders (FEP) varies according to setting-level deprivation and cannabis use, but these factors have not been investigated together. We hypothesized deprivation would be more strongly associated with variation in FEP incidence than prevalence of daily or high-potency cannabis use between settings. Study Design: We used incidence data in people aged 18-64 years from 14 settings of the EU-GEI study. We estimated prevalence of daily and high potency cannabis use in controls as a proxy for usage in the population at-risk; multiple imputation by chained equations and post-stratification weighting handled missing data and control representativeness, respectively. We modeled FEP incidence in random intercepts negative binomial regression models to investigate associations with the prevalence of cannabis use in controls, unemployment and owner-occupancy in each setting, controlling for population density, age, sex, and migrant/ethnic group. Study Results: Lower owner-occupancy was independently associated with increased FEP (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR):0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.61-0.95) and non-affective psychosis incidence (aIRR:0.68; 95%CI:0.55-0.83), after multivariable adjustment. Prevalence of daily cannabis use in controls was associated with incidence of affective psychoses (aIRR:1.53, 95%CI:1.02-2.31). We found no association between FEP incidence and unemployment or high-potency cannabis use prevalence. Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Conclusions: Lower setting-level owner-occupancy and increased prevalence of daily cannabis use in controls independently contributed to setting-level variance in incidence of different psychotic disorders. Public health interventions that reduce exposure to these harmful environmental factors could lower the population-level burden of psychotic disorders.",Psychiatry

An EEG-study on the extent to which partisanship conditions the processing of politicians' faces,"Jesus, Gustavo; Homan, Maaike; Petalas, Diamantis P; Bakker, Bert N; Bathelt, Joe; Schumacher, Gijs","Partisanship has been associated with various cognitive biases. These findings are primarily based on self-reports and task performance and less on measures of neural activity. We build on the related literature on in-group/out-group dynamics that employs a face-viewing paradigm and electroencephalography methods to analyze biases. Reviewing this literature, we developed and preregistered several hypotheses about the extent to which partisanship is associated with neural processing of political faces. Our lab experiment was conducted in the Netherlands (N=51) and sufficiently-powered to pick up modest effect sizes for in-party/out-party comparisons. As preregistered, we find that faces of political leaders elicit a stronger N170 ERP response than faces of strangers, but we did not find the same pattern for the N250 component. Also contrary to our preregistered hypotheses, we find no statistically significant differences in the P200 and N200 components between in-party and out-party leader faces. The strength of partisanship also did not correlate with P200 or N200. We discuss whether different interpretations of these signals (e.g. familiarity or affective processing) guide our theories about how partisan bias emerges and operates.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Increases in EEG Alpha Power and Beta Power Following a VR Psychedelic Journey,"Mattek, Sonny","Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging tool that has been shown to induce experiences similar to psychedelics. In this report, we measure brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) before and after a novel VR experience. This Inner State VR experience was designed as a drugless psychedelic journey that mimics a microdosing experience, to create the opportunity of participating in a psychedelic journey without consumption of a substance. We found the post-VR brain activity showed increases in power in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, compared to pre- VR. We relate these data to existing literature to hypothesize how VR could be a useful tool for creativity and focus, which is consistent with anecdotal use cases of psychedelic microdosing.",Cognitive Neuroscience

Not Simply Two Sides of the Same Coin: Target Enhancement and Distractor Suppression Draw on Independent Neural Mechanisms,"Khodayari, Natalia; Egeth, Howard; courtney, susan","Enhancement and suppression have traditionally been described as a shared process; enhancing relevant information subsequently suppresses irrelevant information, but there may also exist separable mechanisms. Recent evidence indicates that target enhancement and distractor suppression can be measured separately, using both behavioral and physiological approaches. It is unclear, however, whether the underlying mechanisms are also separable. We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals, which would provide strong evidence supporting the existence of separate mechanisms. This approach, however, requires dissociable, internally-reliable individual-difference measures. We found reliable enhancement measures for both endogenous cueing effects (Experiment 1) and statistical learning effects of target location frequency (Experiment 2). Measures of suppression in Experiments 1 and 2 were unreliable. In Experiment 3, we encouraged a single strategy (""singleton-search mode"") by changing the colors and shapes of targets and distractors across trials. We found reliable individual differences in reaction time measures for enhancement and suppression. Critically, these reliable measures of enhancement and suppression did not covary. Experiment 4 largely replicated the results of Experiment 3. Again, individual-difference measures of enhancement and suppression strength did not covary. These results show a clear dissociation: while enhancement yields reliable individual differences across task manipulations, suppression measures are usually unreliable and sensitive to task parameters. When individual-difference measures of both enhancement and suppression are reliable, they do not covary. These results cannot be explained solely by a shared-mechanism account of enhancement and suppression, and instead support the hypothesis that independent enhancement and suppression mechanisms exist.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Social learning in models and minds,"Yon, Daniel; heyes, cecilia","After more than a century in which social learning was blackboxed by evolutionary biologists, psychologists and economists, there is now a thriving industry in cognitive neuroscience producing computational models of learning from and about other agents. This is a hugely positive development. The tools of computational cognitive neuroscience are rigorous and precise. They have the potential to prise open the black box. However, we argue that, from the perspective of a scientific realist, these tools are not yet being applied in an optimal way. To fulfil their potential, the shiny new methods of cognitive neuroscience need to be better coordinated with old-fashioned, contrastive experimental designs. Inferences from model complexity to cognitive complexity, of the kind made by those who favour lean interpretations of behaviour ('associationists'), require social learning to be tested in challenging task environments. Inferences from cognitive complexity to social specificity, made by those who favour rich interpretations ('mentalists'), call for non-social control experiments. A parsimonious model that fits current data is a good start, but carefully designed experiments are needed to distinguish models that tell us how social learning could be done from those that tell us how it is really done.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Mathematized Phenomenology and the Science of Consciousness,"Prentner, Robert","In this contribution, we emphasize the relevance of mathematical approaches to the first-person perspective. We briefly discuss why this is necessary and why mathematics plays a special role when it comes to integrating scientific (empirical) and philosophical (theoretical) projects. We also sketch some potential ways that mathematics could be used in phenomenology, based on a selection of four ``phenomenological primitives'' that characterize constitution: intentionality, minimal subjectivity, lifeworld, and time consciousness. We also spell out a minimal topological toymodel and refer to some contemporary approaches using modern mathematics (e.g. category theory). We then discuss how this could be usefully applied to the (neuro)scientific study of consciousness and throughout stress the need to highlight (and formalize) phenomenology's transcendental character.",Cognitive Neuroscience
Default mode network anti-correlation as a transdiagnostic biomarker of cognitive function,"Tripathi, Vaibhav; Batta, Ishaan; Zamani, Andre; Atad, Daniel A; Sheth, Sneha K; Zhang, Jiahe; Wager, Tor; Whitfield-Gabrieli, Susan; Uddin, Lucina Q; Prakash, Ruchika; Bauer, Clemens C","The default mode network (DMN) is intricately linked with processes such as self-referential thinking, episodic memory recall, self-projection, and understanding the mindset of others. Over recent years, there has been a surge in examining its functional connectivity, particularly its antagonistic relationship with frontoparietal networks (FPN) involved in top-down attention, executive function, and cognitive control. Notably, the DMN demonstrates an anti-correlated connection with FPN and Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), leading to its deactivation when one's attention is turned towards the external environment. The fluidity in switching between these internal and external modes of processing--highlighted by this anti-correlated functional connectivity--has been proposed as an indicator of cognitive health and mediated by salience networks (SAL). Due to the ease of the estimation of functional connectivity-based measures through resting state fMRI paradigms, there is now a wealth of large-scale datasets, paving the way for standardized connectivity benchmarks. This review delves into the promising role of DMN connectivity metrics as potential biomarkers of cognitive state across attention, mind wandering and meditation states, and investigating deviations in clinical conditions such as anxiety, depression, ADHD, PTSD and others. Additionally, we tackle the issue of reliability of network estimation and functional connectivity and share recommendations for using connectivity measures as a biomarker of cognitive health.",Cognitive Neuroscience
