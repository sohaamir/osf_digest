SAS-1: A single-item smartphone addiction scale,"Olson, Jay A; Langer, Ellen J; Martin, Loren","The digital age has brought an increasing concern about the negative effects of smartphone use. However, current measures of smartphone addiction are often too long for some contexts, such as large-scale surveys or pilot studies. Here, we tested a single-item measure that probes agreement with the statement: 'I am addicted to my smartphone'. Across 7,827 participants aged 18 to 89 from 131 countries, 37% agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. Their agreement strongly correlated (r = .67 to .71) with scores on the short version of the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS-SV), the most-used scale in the field. Younger women had the highest scores on both measures, and participants under 30 tended to underestimate their addiction on the single-item scale. Overall, our results suggest that most people have an accurate self-assessment of their own smartphone addiction. This new 1-item scale (SAS-1) can therefore serve as a brief and reliable measure of smartphone addiction when space is limited.",Psychiatry
A psychopathological theory-driven early relapse prediction model using speech and language in psychosis,"Dalal, Tyler C; Park, Min T M; Silva, Angelica; Iskhakova, Svetlana; Voppel, Alban; Brierley, Noah; Mackinley, Michael; Olarewaju, Emmanuel; Palaniyappan, Lena","Language-based prediction of psychotic relapse using speech-derived markers offers a promising avenue for targeted prevention in early intervention. However, the sheer number of speech markers and the 'black box' nature of predictive models present significant challenges for clinical translation. Successful real-world predictions require the underlying model to be a 'reasonable facsimile' of the clinical phenomena that map on the predicted outcomes. We propose a theory-driven approach drawing on the notion that the predictors of early psychotic relapse should mark (1) the presence of schizophrenia in its early stages, and (2) track the positive dimension of formal thought disorder (positive FTD or disorganization) in psychosis. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we derive 3 lexical, syntactic and narrative style markers - semantic similarity, clause complexity, and analytic thinking index. We adopt a prospective design, acquiring speech samples during the acute phase of psychosis (n=68) and following them through remission and subsequent relapses (hospitalizations). With a Bayesian analysis framework, we demonstrate the utility of clinical theory-guided variable selection (disorganization and clause complexity in particular) in improving the predictive accuracy of speech-based models. The psychopathological theory-based speech-NLP model performed better than and provided incremental value to the clinical intuition of expecting a poorly functioning, cannabis-using man with educational deficits to show an early relapse. The findings underscore the potential of automated speech analysis in early relapse prediction during the initial phase of psychosis intervention.",Psychiatry
Generative AI-Enabled Therapy Support Tool Improves Clinical Outcomes and Patient Engagement in NHS Talking Therapies,"Habicht, Johanna; Dina, Larisa M; Stylianou, Mona; Harper, Ross; Hauser, Tobias U; Rollwage, Max","Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of patients do not respond to treatment. The lack of engagement with therapeutic materials and exercises between sessions - a necessary component of CBT - is a key determinant of unsuccessful treatment. Here we tested whether the deployment of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered personalised therapy support tool supporting patients in between sessions leads to improved treatment success and patient engagement with treatment. We conducted a real-world observational study of 137 patients receiving CBT in five of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) Talking Therapies services. Ninety-three patients (68%) used the AI-enabled therapy support tool whilst forty-four patients were provided with the standard CBT worksheets. Patients using the AI-enabled therapy support tool exhibited greater attendance at therapy sessions and fewer dropouts from treatment. Furthermore, these patients demonstrated higher reliable improvement, recovery and reliable recovery rates when compared to the control group. Within the intervention group, the degree of usage of the AI-enabled tool was directly related to the number of attended therapy sessions and reduced dropouts. Our results thus show that an AI-enabled, personalised support tool is a promising avenue to improve treatment outcomes and patient adherence.",Psychiatry
The Habenula in Mood Disorders: A Scoping Review of Human Studies,"Fortin, Jean-Simon; Lafleur, Mathilde; Parisien, Charles; Hetu, Sebastien","In animal models, the habenula has been identified as a key structure involved in depression. Thanks to recent technological advancements, a burgeoning body of work has also investigated the habenula in the context of human mood disorders. This scoping review aims to synthesize findings from human studies that pertain to the habenula and its relationship with mood disorders. The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The literature search was performed with PubMed and yielded 93 articles, of which 50 articles were included in the review. We found that the evidence for baseline habenular hyperactivity in human depression is mixed. As for findings from resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) studies, they were mainly inconsistent across studies. Moreover, we found no evidence indicating that mood disorders are linked to changes in the volume of the habenula. In order to enhance the replicability of findings, given the small size of the habenula, higher image resolution and larger samples are recommended for future studies.",Psychiatry
Assessing alexithymia for positive and negative emotions: the role of granularity and dialecticism,"MAS, Marine; Luana, Comida; Luminet, Olivier","Alexithymia is a transdiagnostic factor for the development and maintenance of psychological symptomatology. Strongly tied to particularities in emotion regulation, recent theorizations consider the difficulties describing and identifying feelings dimensions of alexithymia to influence the appraisal stage of emotional processing. This study aimed at replicating and extending findings from Aaron et al., 2018 by focusing on differentiating alexithymia for positive and negative emotions. Participants (n=125, mean age 45 y.o; 74% women) evaluated their emotional experience after watching videos inducing anger, disgust, sadness, fear, amusement and tenderness. Alexithymia was measured by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire (PAQ). No association between alexithymia and positive emotional complexity was observed despite the use of the PAQ assessing alexithymia for positive emotions. Difficulties describing and identifying negative feelings from PAQ were predicted by lower negative granularity. Difficulties describing feelings from both scales were predicted by higher negative dialecticism. These results confirm the association between alexithymia facets and emotional complexity regarding negative emotions and emphasize the importance of controlling for negative affect in alexithymia studies. Finally, high alexithymia was characterized by higher reporting of negative affective states compared to positives states following positive induction, which questions the interpretation of dialecticism in alexithymia.",Psychiatry
Discriminative Validity and Interpretability of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire,"Mansueto, Sara; Kumar, Rohina; Raitman, Michelle R; Jahagirdar, Anisha; Chen, Sheng; Wang, Wei; Krause, Karolin R; Monga, Suneeta; szatmari, peter; Courtney, Darren","Background: Using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) to differentiate between depression severity levels remains unexplored. We assessed the discriminative validity of the MFQ to identify an optimal cut-off MFQ score to distinguish between subthreshold-to-mild and moderate-to-severe depression severity levels. Methods: An observational cross-sectional design was used in a sample (N=67) of help-seeking youth (ages 13 to 18, inclusive) experiencing depressive symptoms. The MFQ was administered verbatim to youth by a research analyst over the phone. Youth were then grouped into subthreshold-to-mild or moderate-to-severe depression severity categories based on scores received on the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Depression Rating Scale. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyses were conducted, with area under the curve (AUC) and Youden Index (J) as primary indices. We hypothesized that the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the area under the curve would be >= 0.70. Results: The primary analysis yielded an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.763 - 0.947) and an optimal cut-off of >=43 (J = 0.60, positive predictive value = 91.4%, negative predictive value = 62.5%, sensitivity = 72.7%, specificity = 87.0%). Limitations: Our study collected a small sample, disproportionately consisting of adolescents that are White, female sex assigned at birth, identifying as girl/woman gender, born in Canada, and having other comorbid disorders. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings highlight the potential for the MFQ to support clinical decision-making relevant to adolescents experiencing varying severities of depressive symptoms in secondary care settings.",Psychiatry
ENIGMA-Meditation: Worldwide consortium for neuroscientific investigations of meditation practices,"Ganesan, Saampras; Tsuchiyagaito, Aki; Siegle, Greg; goldin, philippe; Eyler, Lisa T; Treves, Isaac N; LUTZ, Antoine; Pagnoni, Giuseppe; Dagnino, Paulina C; Escrichs, Anira; Saccaro, Luigi F; Sacchet, Matthew D; Tripathi, Vaibhav; Batta, Ishaan; Prakash, Ruchika; Brown, Kirk W; Reggente, Nicco; Khalsa, Sahib S; McDermott, Timothy J; Valk, Sofie; Tang, Yi-Yuan; Fani, Negar; Deco, Gustavo; Garland, Eric; Calhoun, Vince D; Davanger, Svend; Piguet, Camille; Bauer, Clemens C; Barrios, Fernando A; Chetelat, Gael; Kirlic, Namik; Fresco, David M; Rahrig, Hadley; Torske, Alyssa; Kang, Yoona; Cain, Joshua; Farb, Norman A S; Garg, Rahul; Turner, Matthew D; Fialoke, Suruchi; Hafeman, Danella M; Dutcher, Janine M; Brewer, Judson A; Creswell, J.

Over the last 40 years, clinical science has manualised meditation practices and designed various meditation interventions (MIs), that have shown therapeutic efficacy for disorders including depression, pain, addiction, and anxiety. Over the past decade, neuroimaging has examined the neuroscientific basis of meditation practices, effects, states, and outcomes for clinical and non-clinical populations. However, the generalizability and replicability of current neuroscientific models of meditation are yet to be established, as they are largely based on small datasets entrenched with heterogeneity along several domains of meditation (e.g., practice types, meditation experience, clinical disorder targeted), experimental design, and neuroimaging methods (e.g., preprocessing, analysis, task-based, resting-state, structural MRI). These limitations have precluded a nuanced and rigorous neuroscientific phenotyping of meditation practices and their potential benefits. Here, we present ENIGMA-Meditation, the first worldwide collaborative consortium for neuroscientific investigations of meditation practices. ENIGMA-Meditation will enable systematic meta- and mega-analyses of globally distributed neuroimaging datasets of meditation using shared, standardized neuroimaging methods and tools to improve statistical power and generalizability. Through this powerful collaborative framework, existing neuroscientific accounts of meditation practices can be extended to generate novel and rigorous neuroscientific insights, accounting for multi-domain heterogeneity. ENIGMA-Meditation will inform neuroscientific mechanisms underlying therapeutic action of meditation practices on psychological and cognitive attributes, advancing the field of meditation and contemplative neuroscience.",Psychiatry
Programming The Mind - The Seven Dimensions of Attachment in Personality and Psychopathology,"Gagliardi, Marcantonio","This book presents an innovative, comprehensive theoretical framework for Clinical Psychology: The MAPP - Mind Architecture, Personality, and Psychopathology. Through a cognitive-evolutionary perspective, the theory builds the common ground necessary to integrate the different and valuable contributions from all schools and orientations in Clinical Psychology. Moreover, the engineering approach embraced by the MAPP offers a methodological direction through which such contributions can be further developed. The focus is on the individual psychological differences caused by the information stored in a standard, organically healthy brain substrate. As its name suggests, the theory is divided into the following three parts. 1. An architecture of the mind (and motivational systems), which provides a general model of its structures and functions consisting of a multitude of interconnected modules. Motivational and data systems are the central part of the architecture, and the attachment motivational system and data module play a pivotal role in human psychology. 2. A model of personality according to which attachment is at its core. Attachment theory is revised and extended, identifying seven attachment dimensions - disorganization, avoidance, ambivalence, phobicity, depressivity, somaticity, and obsessivity - acquired through imprinting in attachment-caregiving interactions. We are biological machines programmed by our caregivers. 3. A Model of (behavior and) psychopathology. The outlined models of motivation and personality underpin a new model of behavioral dynamics and mental disorders. Psychopathology is characterized by a central causal chain: negative social relationships cause dysfunctional knowledge to be acquired, and this knowledge causes mental disorders. The most common pathologies stem from attachment dimensions. By clarifying their etiology, the model allows for a deeper understanding of mental disorders and the development of more effective assessment tools and treatments. Finally, the MAPP is tested through the discussion of ten complex case studies inspired by the literature. Overall, the MAPP provides a novel theoretical framework for Clinical Psychology that empowers the discipline to overcome its current principal limits with a significant impact on assessment and treatment. The theory is particularly suitable for Artificial Intelligence applications and the development of automatic assessment tools.",Psychiatry
